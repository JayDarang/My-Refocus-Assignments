Hello! My name is Jayson, and I have recently returned to the Philippines after working abroad as an OFW in South Korea. During my time in Seoul, I had the opportunity to study photography and develop my skills in capturing street scenes, which has become one of my favorite hobbies. Aside from photography, I also enjoy playing console games, particularly on my PlayStation. 

This year, I have set a goal to buy a car before the year ends. But what I'm really excited about is becoming a web developer. I studied Information Technology in college, but I haven't had a chance to use those skills in my previous jobs. I want to learn more about web development because I think it's a fascinating field. It's also a job that I can do remotely, which would be really cool.

I'm excited about the opportunity to use my knowledge and skills in a field that I'm passionate about. I'm looking forward to learning more and exploring the possibilities that come with being a web developer.
